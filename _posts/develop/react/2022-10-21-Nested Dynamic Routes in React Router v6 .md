When I first started to develop my portfolio, I fetched GitHub Repos and ran into the issue of needing to present the repo data when clicking on the repo name precisely as seen in the image below.

If you look closely, you'll see that the URL is dynamically altered to reflect the chosen repository's name and the proper repo data is rendered. The term "dynamic routing" refers to this behavior.

I came up with this [Sandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/dynamic-routing-with-react-router-dom-dw8kln) example to help you better understand this type of behavior.
