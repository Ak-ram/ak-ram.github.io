We learnt how to nest Scss rules in the [last post](https://dev.to/ak_ram/sass-interpolation-nesting-4d73). Today, we'll go into more depth regarding nesting.

**In this post, we will cover:-**

1. Parent Selector and pseudo-classes
2. Grouping and Nesting CSS Selectors
3. Selector Nest Combinators

Each point will be discussed in depth.

## 1. Parent Selector and pseudo-classes

[Official SASS document](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector#:~:text=The%20parent%20selector%2C%20%26%20%2C%20is,a%20selector%20before%20the%20parent.) states that

> The parent selector, & , is a special selector invented by Sass that's used in nested selectors to refer to the outer selector

To further understand, consider the example below.

`&` here works as a reference to the outer selector which is `.main .alert`

It may be puzzling to you how such a selector may be helpful, right? Parent selector is most commonly used in:

1.1 _**Suffix classes** context.

Many frameworks, including Bootstrap, have this pattern.

1.2 **_Pseudo classes_** also utilize a parent selector.

1.3 also `&` can be used as an argument inside pseudo-selectors functions:

## 2. Grouping and Nesting CSS Selectors

We use a comma as a separator when there are many selectors in a list.

## 3. Selector Nest Combinators (>, +, ~, space)

selector combinators can be placed in many places as shown below:

I almost covered everything I know about SCSS nesting; nevertheless, in the following post, we'll talk about a new subject called [placeholder selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors).
