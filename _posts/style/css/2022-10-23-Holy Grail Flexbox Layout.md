[The Holy Grail Layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)) is a well-known CSS issue that has had a number of remedies throughout time. If you're not aware of the background of the Holy Grail layout, this [A List Apart article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-holy-grail-layout) provides a decent overview and links to some of the most well-known alternatives.

Exactly like in the image above, a page with a header, footer, and three columns makes up the Holy Grail Layout's basic structure. The left and right columns have supplementary material, such as navigation or adverts, while the center column is home to the primary text.



Unfortunately, none of the traditional remedies to this issue have ever been able to completely achieve all of these aims due to the nature of these objectives and the original CSS constraints.

Finally, a comprehensive solution is feasible with Flexbox.
